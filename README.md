# ECommerce-Development
This repository will detail the indepth methodology on developing an Ecommerce website, and for general Supply Chain Automation. The project in detail was accomplished using Spring Boot for the backend server, MySQL for backend storage, JPA for Object-Relational Mapping, ReactJS for frontend along with some Xero API intergration. The finished product allows franchisees to login to the system, browse the available stock from the frontend linked to the backend and through the Xero API, and place orders. The system will then create an invoice and bill the user through the Xero API and send an invoice through their email. The payment gateway will also be implemented through Xero's configuration system. Due to confidentiality and security issues, large portions of code cannot be uploaded here, but this repository will give a detailed review on the process and possible obstacles that come when implementing an ecommerce website.
